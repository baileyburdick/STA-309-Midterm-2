# STA-309-Midterm-2
This is my STA 309 Midterm 2 final submission. This project takes earthquake data and gives us the freedom to make our own dashboard.
I decided to research earthquake detection history and see how different technology affects detection over the year. The Global Seismographic Network was implemented in 1984. GSN is a permanent digital network of seismometers that measure the vibrations of the world. I focused on 1974-1994 to see the earthquake trends before and immediately after the implementation of GSN. I found that GSN created more consistent earthquake predictions with less variance. 
I portrayed this data with three graphs. The first one shows the number of earthquaked over time. My goal was to see the overall trend. Next, I wanted to see this trend in the 10 years before and after the implementation of GSN. I found that the new technology helped create more consistent earthquake detections. Finally, I looked at the maximum depth and standard deviation fo depth from 1974-1994. The earthquake depth was more consistent and had less SD after the new technology.
Overall, the GSN technology is a good addition, as it helped detetction become more consistent.
